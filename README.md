# Alien Invasion Game

## Overview

Alien Invasion is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a spaceship and defends against waves of alien invaders. The game includes movement controls for the spaceship, shooting functionality, multiple levels, and a score system. The objective of the game is to eliminate all aliens before they reach the spaceship.

This game is built using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. It runs directly in the browser and uses the `<canvas>` element for rendering graphics.

## Features

- Player controls the spaceship with arrow keys (`left` and `right`).
- Shoot projectiles with the `Space` bar.
- Alien invaders move horizontally and vertically, with increasing difficulty as the player advances.
- Each alien has a different color to make the game visually appealing.
- Score is tracked and displayed at the top left of the screen.
- Game over occurs when an alien touches the spaceship.

## How to Play

1. **Move** the spaceship left and right using the **Arrow Keys**.
2. Press **Space** to shoot bullets and destroy aliens.
3. **Eliminate all aliens** to progress to the next level.
4. **Game Over** occurs if any alien reaches the bottom of the screen.
